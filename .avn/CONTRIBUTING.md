## Reporting Bugs

If you're having a problem, please `cd` to the directory where your
`.node-version` file is stored and run (note the double-underscore prefix):

```bash
__avn_debug
```

Please report your issue to the appropriate team based on your version manager:

 - `nvm`: [`avn` issues][issues]
 - `n`: [`avn` issues][issues]
 - `nodebrew`: [`avn-nodebrew` issues][issues]

The `avn` community is composed of plugins that are maintained by the `avn` team as well as plugins that are maintained by other community members, so reporting your issue to the correct team will ensure it gets handled quickly.
